Of course, some stuff in here is much better and easier to get into than other stuff.
 These may be okay to start with:
* Advanced Statistical Computing
* [Machine] Learning
* Bayesian Statistics
* Computer Systems
* C++ (though I started that supposedly advanced course 8 weeks after my first day of coding (in Prolog (I lost the assignments for that course)))
* Data Structures & Algorithms
* Statistical Learning
