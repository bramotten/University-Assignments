    "Infomap is an implementation of a distributional semantic model that can be queried online at http://clic.cimec.unitn.it/infomap-query/. For a target word, it will return its $n$ nearest semantic neighbours ordered by similarity strength (calculated using cosine similarity between vectors in semantic space). Have a look at the model options that can be selected in the querying interface. Read the Infomap documentation (link at the end of the  page) and briefly summarise (in your own words) the features of the model option **bnc-lemma-narrow**. Your summary should include the language for which the model has been constructed, the corpus used, the characteristics of the target words (the rows), and the size of the context.\n",
