Of course, some of the assignments are much better and easier to get into than others.
 
These courses required some ingenuity (though I took them in the first 2 years of the bachelor):
* Computer Systems
* C++
* Data Structures & Algorithms

And these are relatively clean:
* Advanced Statistical Computing
* Machine Learning
* Bayesian Statistics
* Statistical Learning
