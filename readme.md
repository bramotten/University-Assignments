Of course, some stuff in here is much better and easier to get into than other stuff.
 
These required some ingenuity (though I took them in the first 2 years of the bachelor):
* Computer Systems
* C++
* Data Structures & Algorithms

And these are relatively clean:
* Advanced Statistical Computing
* [Machine] Learning
* Bayesian Statistics
* Statistical Learning
